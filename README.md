<b>Langs and Tools used</b>

### optimizations

css
- background images, 
- fonts used
- as you can see, from the example images, there are differnt stylings being used. I am still deciding what I want to play around with and how to put my own signature styling on this stuff. 

javascript

### Lessons Learned

routing to different pages, deleting and toggling, using conditionals to manipulate the dom with EJS, and targeting specific attributes/selectors within an element tag with . notation. 

one thing I'm focused on learning more of are the mongoDB methods due to the fact that some of them will do incredibly different things with your information like the difference between insertOne, save and findONeAndUpdate.
